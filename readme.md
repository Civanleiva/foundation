# Foundation vs Bootstrap

What sticks out to me the most is how Foundation seems to have a more neutral approach when it comes to element design.
Bootstrap elements tend to follow a very clearly set design philosophy (just like Google's Material Design), which makes
Bootstrap sites stick out like a sore thumb in most cases. Having more neutral elements by default is a clear nod to how
Foundation is built with customization in mind. Foundation is incredibly easy to customize with their settings approach,
it feels much more like calling an API than using a CSS library, which is great.

What I didn't like about Foundation is their grid system. It feels straight up inferior to flexbox based grids, for one,
they are much less responsive out of the box and might require some tweaking to get right. This isn't as bad considering
Foundation's customizability, but it's not what you would expect from a CSS library.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 6 or greater recommended, tested with 6.11.4 and 8.12.0)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Foundation for Sites project with this template:

```bash
foundation new --framework sites --template zurb
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

Now `cd` to your project name and to start your project run 

```bash
foundation watch
```

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
yarn
```

Finally, run `yarn start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `yarn run build`.
